# CPSC 210 - Term Project

## A Coffee Shop Simulator 

The project that I propose to complete this term is a coffee shop simulator game. You will play the barista and 
owner of a bustling cozy coffee shop. As the barista: 

    - Take orders from your customers and make their favourite drinks
    - Collect customer reviews and improve your coffee shop's star rating 
    - Make as much money as you can, you're an entrepreneur after all!

I chose a caf√© because I personally love coffee, and relaxing casual games have always been my favourite.

## User Stories
    - As a user, I want to recieve my customers orders, make the drinks and collect payment.
    - As a user and a coffee shop owner, I want to be able to add new Drinks to my Menu
      for my customers to enjoy. 
    - As a user, I want to be able to remove drinks from my menu.
    - As a user, I want to be able to view how much money I've earned at my coffee shop.
    - As a user, I want to view my current coffee shop's menu. 
    - As a user, when I close my shop I want the option to save my coffee shop's progress to file.
    - As a user, when I start my application I want the option to load my coffee shop's progress
      and continue from the saved state.
